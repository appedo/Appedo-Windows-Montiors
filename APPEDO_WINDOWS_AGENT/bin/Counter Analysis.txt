Column to be added are 
1. dd_cnt_name
2. dd_cat_name
3. instance_names json type

IN UI system must allow the user to choose the drill down mapping for is top process, dd_cnt_name and dd_category name - Only one drill down per counter allowed
When drill down (dd) is enabled, even though the counter is not selected, system must send that list in module_counter_list variable.

Thread Wait Reason

Thread State
Thread State is the current state of the thread.  It is 0 for Initialized, 1 for Ready, 2 for Running, 3 for Standby, 4 for Terminated, 5 for Wait, 6 for Transition, 7 for Unknown.  A Running thread is using a processor; a Standby thread is about to use one.  A Ready thread wants to use a processor, but is waiting for a processor because none are free.  A thread in Transition is waiting for a resource in order to execute, such as waiting for its execution stack to be paged in from disk.  A Waiting thread has no use for the processor because it is waiting for a peripheral operation to complete or a resource to become free.
Thread Wait Reason
Thread Wait Reason is only applicable when the thread is in the Wait state (see Thread State).  It is 0 or 7 when the thread is waiting for the Executive, 1 or 8 for a Free Page, 2 or 9 for a Page In, 3 or 10 for a Pool Allocation, 4 or 11 for an Execution Delay, 5 or 12 for a Suspended condition, 6 or 13 for a User Request, 14 for an Event Pair High, 15 for an Event Pair Low, 16 for an LPC Receive, 17 for an LPC Reply, 18 for Virtual Memory, 19 for a Page Out; 20 and higher are not assigned at the time of this writing.  Event Pairs are used to communicate with protected subsystems (see Context Switches).

Process for performance counter.
1. Single config file to be maintained for windows, iis and mssql.
2. mssql credential must be kept in the config file.
3. no uuid or guid to be maintained in the config file. 
4. on restart or first time installation, system will get the uuid and send to the collector. Collector will check for its existance of uuid first, if not exsit will send sucess=true, message:"uuid does not exist" 
5. if uuid exist collector will check for matching guids from counter master table and will send the guids and its counter set ex. currently it is sending monitor counter set and sla counter set for a single guid, instead it will send for each guid montior and sla counter set guidwise.
6. in case of missing guids system will check for its existance on every restart. Ex. if iis guid is not returned then system will check whether iis is running an application. if application is running, iis counter will be monitored. 
7. once guid is received along with counter set, system will start collecting the data for the same and it will work as before.
8. System might have multiple instance of mssql running in a machine. -- curently will monitor one instance only. connection string decide on the instance that is being monitored.
